**Flutter Expense Tracker**

A sleek and user-friendly Expense Tracker app built using Flutter. This application helps you keep track of your personal spending habits by allowing you to log, view, and analyze your expenses in real time. Designed with clean UI components and dynamic charts, itâ€™s ideal for everyday use.

**Features**
1. Add Transactions: Quickly log your expenses with a title, amount, and date.
2. View Transactions: See your recent spending in an easy-to-read list.
3. Delete Transactions: Easily remove unwanted or incorrect entries.
4. Filter by Date: View only the transactions from the last 7 days.
5. Spending Chart: Visualize your weekly spending patterns using a dynamic bar chart.
6. Responsive UI: Adaptive layout that looks great on both Android and iOS devices.
7. Dark Mode Friendly (optional): Easily integrate with system themes.
8. Live UI Updates: Immediate reflection of changes as you add/delete data.

**How It Works**
The app follows a simple but effective architecture using the core Flutter widget system:

1. main.dart: Initializes the app and sets up the home screen.
2. New Transaction Form:
    Opens a modal form to add a new transaction.
    Validates input before submission.
3. Transaction List View:
    Displays all added transactions with amount, title, and date.
    Swipe-to-delete feature included.
4. Chart View:
    A visual summary of daily expenses over the last 7 days.
    Each bar's height is proportional to that day's spending.

**Customization Ideas**
If you'd like to extend or personalize the app, here are some suggestions:
1. Categories: Tag expenses (e.g., food, travel, shopping).
2. Cloud Sync: Connect to Firebase or another backend for persistent storage.
3. Reminders: Add notifications for recurring expenses.
4. Monthly/Yearly Reports: Expand charts to longer time ranges.
5. Authentication: Lock app with PIN or biometrics.

This Flutter Expense Tracker is great as a beginner-friendly project, a portfolio app, or a personal budgeting tool. Let me know if you want this exported as a Markdown file or want to add Firebase/SQLite integration instructions too.
